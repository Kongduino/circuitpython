based on the wonderfull piece of code of Scott Shawcroft
original version from https://github.com/tannewt/basicpython
originaly is an experiment to edit Python code like BASIC was edited.
The idea is imagining this as the default mode on a Raspberry Pi 400.

i ported it to Adafruit Pyportal Titano circuitpython
(work on wio terminal under circuitpython too)

i added i2c m5stack keyboard CardKB but can work with any keyboard
i added a dir function to list files in directory

on next update will try to add more features to act as a light os

this make our little gadgets autonomous for running and coding on the go

Enjoy it.

change log
