<h1>Pimoroni Badger2040 </h1>

BadgerOS portage (and enchanced) in circuitpython from original pimoroni in micropython<cr/>
<cr/>
The question is why ? <cr/>
Micropython is great but not friendly to main public. Circuipython is better for that :<cr/>
mount as USB drive, then can manage you device by just drag and drop files (example a badge text file).<cr/>
