<h1>Pimoroni Badger2040 </h1>

BadgerOS port (and enhancement) to CircuitPython from the original Pimoroni MicroPython version.<cr/>
<cr/>
The question is, why?<cr/>

Micropython is great but not friendly to the public. CircuitPython is better for that:<cr/>

Mount the device as a USB drive, then you can manage it by just dragging and dropping files (eg a badge text file).<cr/>

This version is for [this version]( https://adafruit-circuit-python.s3.amazonaws.com/bin/pimoroni_badger2040/fr/adafruit-circuitpython-pimoroni_badger2040-fr-20220312-f13d218.uf2) (Adafruit CircuitPython 7.3.0-alpha.0-39-gf13d21874 on 2022-03-12; Pimoroni Badger 2040 with rp2040)

This doesn't include displayio, another version will be done for other versions with displayio.
