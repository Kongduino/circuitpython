<h1>Pimoroni Badger2040 </h1>

BadgerOS port (and enhancement) to CircuitPython from the original Pimoroni MicroPython version.<cr/>
<cr/>
The question is, why?<cr/>

Micropython is great but not friendly to the public. CircuitPython is better for that:<cr/>

Mount the device as a USB drive, then you can manage it by just dragging and dropping files (eg a badge text file).<cr/>

## Update March 22, 2022:
Added QRcode functions on badges. when displaying a badge press the bottom arrow to replace the photo with a QRcode (.vcf format) compatible with all mobiles.look at the example text files to see the format, but the new format is (one field per line) :

- company
- name
- detail1_title
- detail1_text
- detail2_title
- detail2_text
- Work phone number
- Cell phone number
- email
- Web site link

If you have no information to put, leave the line blank

Other addition (Beta) battery voltage in the bar. In the next update the battery logo will be updated, I still have to find the high and low limits of the battery, but as the epaper does not consume almost anything it may take me a while.

addon 11h : bug fixes , and battery level beta version show correct icon value and voltage in top bar

## Update March 21, 2022:
a big thank you to Chris Parrott for his help, we can now fix the pin 3V3 (GPIO10) to high. 
fixed a bug where the HID was crashing at boot if not connected to the USB (logical) now at boot we test if connected or not to the usb to disable the HID features (to reactivate reboot).

Warning: on battery press a button for (about 20 sec to wake up the badge) to put it in standby and save battery. press reset. The badge will wake up by itself if you connect it to a usb

## Update March 17, 2022:
all the code has been rewritten to take into account the use of Adafruit DisplayIO libraries (with management of texts, 4 bits black & white BMP images, and also shapes). For the moment I haven't activated the battery display (I have a problem on my badger, it doesn't seem to work on battery and I haven't found yet why (maybe my device has a defect).

## todo: 
management of the battery level. (beta version 22.03.2022)

~~the "info" part~~ : done 17.03.2022<cr/>

the "prefs" part to set (in the non volatile memory) the hid parameters for the moment set in "hard" in the code by "layout = fr or layout = us <cr/>

Code the list function as in the original micropython version.<cr/>

# User's Manual : 

## # create a badge:
it's quite simple in the folder "badges" just create a text file (with notepad for example) for the structure look at the file empty.txt in this directory but it gives this (one information per line):
- company
- name
- detail1_title
- detail1_text
- detail2_title
- detail2_text
- Work phone number (only showed in Qrcode)
- Cell phone number (only showed in Qrcode)
- email             (only showed in Qrcode)
- Web site link     (only showed in Qrcode)
- 
and for the photo from for example the freeware "[paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html "paint.net")" you have to make an image in 104x128 pixels and save it in BMP 4 bits format.
 
## # create a HID/rubber ducky command

this function allows your Badger2040 to behave like a keyboard and send text keystrokes when connected to a computer (useful in pentesting campaigns for red teams, but we'll come back to this a little bit later).

for more information about rubber ducky scripts, [click on this link.](https://docs.hak5.org/usb-rubber-ducky-1/the-ducky-script-language/ducky-script-quick-reference "click on this link.")

to make your own, nothing more simple from a text editor create a text file in the "hid" directory and at the next reset it will appear in the available scripts press the button to launch the script.

a "hidden" hid function is present : at boot time if you hold one of the 5 buttons (a , b , c , up , down) before changing the display (which allows to keep the display unchanged) it will execute at the root the corresponding script when you release the button (the led stays on the time to release and turns off once the script is executed.

correspondence : 

- button a -> run a.txt
- button b -> run b.txt
- button c -> run c.txt
- button up -> run up.txt
- button down -> runs down.txt

and the program executes them in this order if you are fast enough you can execute for example a then c then down (it allows to prepare several fights)

once executed the badge will wait for the pressure of a button to continue towards the Launcher (the led flashes in waiting). that allows you to disconnect the badge without that the display is not changed (useful within the framework of an intrusion red team the badge continues to display an identity for example) it is more discrete and easy has to pass than a key usb rubber ducky.

## #display an image 

nothing more simple copy in the directory " images " your images 296x128 pixels in BMP 4 bits format (black and white). at the next reset they will be available in the menu.

## #Ebook function (.txt reader)

simply copy your .txt file in the ebook directory and at the next reset it will be available in the menu.
