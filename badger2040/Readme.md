<h1>Pimoroni Badger2040 </h1>

BadgerOS port (and enhancement) to CircuitPython from the original Pimoroni MicroPython version.<cr/>
<cr/>
The question is, why?<cr/>

Micropython is great but not friendly to the public. CircuitPython is better for that:<cr/>

Mount the device as a USB drive, then you can manage it by just dragging and dropping files (eg a badge text file).<cr/>
