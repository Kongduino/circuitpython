<h1>Pimoroni Badger2040 </h1>

BadgerOS portage (and enchanced) in circuitpython from original pimoroni in micropython<cr/>
<cr/>
The question is why ? <cr/>
Micropython is great but not friendly to main public. Circuipython is better for that :<cr/>
mount as USB drive, then can manage you device by just drag and drop files (example a badge text file).<cr/>
this version is for this version https://adafruit-circuit-python.s3.amazonaws.com/bin/pimoroni_badger2040/fr/adafruit-circuitpython-pimoroni_badger2040-fr-20220312-f13d218.uf2 (Adafruit CircuitPython 7.3.0-alpha.0-39-gf13d21874 on 2022-03-12; Pimoroni Badger 2040 with rp2040)
