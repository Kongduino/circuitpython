<h1>Basic Python for PyPortal (Works on Wio Terminal too!)</h1>

Based on the wonderful piece of code by Scott Shawcroft, original version from https://github.com/tannewt/basicpython.
Originally ir is an experiment to edit Python code like BASIC was edited. The idea is to imagine this as the default mode on a Raspberry Pi 400.

I ported it to Adafruit Pyportal Titano CircuitPython (works on Wio Terminal under CircuitPython too).

I added support for the I2C M5Stack CardKB keyboard, but it can work with any keyboard. I added a `dir` function to list files in a directory.

On the next update, I will try to add more features to act as a light OS.

This makes our little gadgets autonomous for running and coding on the go.

Enjoy!
