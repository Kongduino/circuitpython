<h1>Boot App Selector</h1>

Boot App Selector is an application selector for Adafruit MagTag. 

It allows you to choose the application that will be launched after each reset. To change the application you have to press (you have 2 sec after the reset, leave the button pressed for 5 sec) on the Button A (D15) to restore the application selector and then choose which application will be launched by default.

this menu is in development phase but works as it is for the moment or can be used as a base for your projects.
